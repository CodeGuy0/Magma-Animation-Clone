 # About The Project :
 This project is a clone of the Magma website, designed to showcase my skills in frontend development. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the core structure and functionality. Additionally, I incorporated Canvas, GSAP, and Locomotive Scroll to create dynamic animations and enhance the overall user experience.
